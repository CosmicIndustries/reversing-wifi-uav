stream_handler.py: A file that listens for video stream packets and decodes them using OpenCV or another library.
. stream_handler.py - Video Stream Handling
This will allow you to capture the video stream and display or save it using OpenCV.

Steps to Use the Altered Files
Run teleop.py:

This file sends control commands like takeoff, landing, and camera tilt.
Simply run it in a Python environment:
bash
Copy code
python teleop.py
Run autonomous_control.py:

This script uses sensor data for autonomous flight.
Ensure that your IMU and GPS sensors are properly configured.
Run it:
bash
Copy code
python autonomous_control.py
Run stream_handler.py:

This file will display the video stream from the drone in a window.
Run it:
bash
Copy code
python stream_handler.py
Next Steps
Integrating sensors: Ensure that your IMU and GPS modules are correctly interfaced with the Python code.
Testing: Test each script separately to ensure proper communication and functionality.
Enhancements: Add more complex autonomous features like obstacle detection, dynamic waypoint generation, or path planning.
